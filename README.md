# GPT-Cloak-GPT-Zero-bypass
python scrip that adds spaces in between your words at random interval in font 1, which makes your ai text undetectable by gptzero. it has two uses, it will type out any text you give it at approx 44 wpm so if you are working in a monitored environment it seems like your pasted text is being typed. the second use takes your text and adds an extra space in between your words at random interval in font 1, and types it out, use google docs or else the extra space will not be font 1.
